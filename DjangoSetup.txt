1. Install Python 2.7 (After install add to PATH)

2. Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper which provide a dedicated environment for each Django project you create. 
   This will allow you to create VIRTUAL ENVIROMENT where PYTHON will be copy and
   DJANGO will be downloaded. With this option your PYTHON installation on Windows will be unchanged.
   
   Commad to install virtualenv:
   $ pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
   
   Then create a virtual environment for your project:
   $ mkvirtualenv myproject


   The virtual environment will be activated automatically and you’ll see “(myproject)” next to the command prompt to designate that.
   If you start a new command prompt, you’ll need to activate the environment again using:
   $ workon myproject
   
3. Install Django for your virtual enviroment
   In the command prompt, ensure your virtual environment is active, and execute the following command:
   $ pip install django
   
   To verfiy that Django is installed type (if is everything OK command will return Django version that is installed):
   $ django-admin --version
   
4. Install Python libraries required for data analysis in the virtual enviroment:
   $ pip install numpy
   $ pip install 
   
5. In eclipse set the path to Python intpreter to be to python that is installed in virtual enviroment
